## Overview and Origin
----
* Coinbase ![](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/img/exchanges/coinbase.png)

* Incorporated June 20, 2012

* Founded by Brian Armstrong & Fred Ehrsam ![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8pr_vzvgDD-KmN_2bkbF_AAAAA?pid=ImgDet&w=164&h=128.46666666666667&c=7&dpr=1.5)

* The company was founded on the basis that anyone, anywhere could be able to easily and securely trade Bitcoin.

* Coinbase has raised a total of $547.3M in funding over 16 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Oct 1, 2020 from a Venture - Series Unknown round. Coinbase is registered under the ticker NASDAQ:COIN. Their stock opened with $381.00 in its APRIL 14, 2021 IPO. Coinbase is funded by 65 investors. Pegasus Tech Ventures and Paradigm are among the most recent investors.


## Business Activities:
----
* A major problem Coinbase is trying to solve is with security where if your account is compromised then it will not recognize your identity if you want to open a new account.

* Coinbase hopes to make trading in cryptocurrency accessible to everyone with over sixty eight million customers to date.
From what I've learned, Coinbase offers a debit card that gives 4% cash back rewards in the crypto of your choice for every purchase you make wherever Visa cards are accepted. It also provides sweepstakes where you have opportunity to potentially win millions of dollars for having an account and entering for a chance to win.

* Coinbase uses many technology products and services, some major ones include Query and Transact, Cloud based services for Web3 with API and node infrastructure and Wallet SDK to link dapps to Coinbase Wallet.


## Landscape:
----
* The company's domain is Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

* As of December 17th, 2021 the global crypto market cap is $2.17 trillion making it the eighth largest economy in the world based on gross domestic product. The average daily cryptocurrency trade volume has risen to an incredible $109 billion per day.

* Other major companies include Gemini, eToro, Coinmama and more.


## Results
----
* Coinbase has made trading in cryptocurrency very simple with an easy interface that allows you to view prices and projections in order to buy at their low point and sell at their high point.

* The metrics used to monitor success are: Aquisition, Activation, Retention, Referrals, Revenues, Marketing and Technical. Unfortuntely, Coinbase is still behind in terms of security in regards to being locked out of your account if your email you signed up with becomes compromised.

* Coinbase seems to be lacking in terms of security when compared to Gemini, as well as in fees when compared to the lower fees that other companies such as eToro has.


## Recommendations
----
* According to Dr. Clippinger, a solution for Coinbase's security problem would be a global identity token especially one provided in the form of a hard wallet.

* This would create a safe way to store your identity to not only your account for coinbase, but according to the article & Dr. Clippinger, could be used to store your personal information such as your SSN and other important documentation.

* This service would utilize facial recognition software similar to the one used by Apple but in a hard wallet device that stores your digital fingerprint.

* Being in a hard wallet, the service would prevent deep fakes by ensuring that only your device could access your information.
